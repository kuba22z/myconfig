# myconfig
###  This is a bare Git repository
- this is a way to store dotfiles
- The technique consists in storing a Git bare repository in a "side" folder (like $HOME/.myconfig)
- use alias "config" so that commands are run against that repository and not the usual .git local folder, which would interfere with any other Git repositories around.
